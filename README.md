## Overview

The **Quantium Virtual Internship Program** provides hands-on experience in building data-driven applications and improving them with interactive features, testing, and automation. The key areas of focus included setting up a virtual environment, performing data preprocessing, developing a Dash-based dashboard, and ensuring the application's robustness through unit testing and automation.

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1: Virtual Environment Setup

In this task, I set up the virtual environment required for the project. This included installing necessary dependencies and libraries such as **Dash**, **Pandas**, and **Plotly** to ensure smooth development of the application.

### Task 2: Data Processing and Feature Engineering

Data processing and feature engineering involved cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for visualization. Key actions included:
- Handling missing values
- Creating new features
- Normalizing and scaling data for optimal performance

### Task 3: Creating Dash Application

The core of this task was to create a simple Dash application. This included:
- Building a user interface (UI) for displaying data visualizations
- Utilizing **Plotly** for creating various charts and graphs
- Designing the layout using Dash components such as **Graph**, **Dropdown**, and **Slider**

### Task 4: Improving Dash Application with Callbacks

In this task, I enhanced the Dash application by making it more interactive through the use of **callbacks**. This allowed dynamic updates to the charts and UI elements based on user input, such as selecting different datasets, filtering data, or adjusting parameters using sliders.

### Task 5: Coding Unit Tests for Dash Application

To ensure the application worked correctly, I wrote **unit tests** to verify the functionality of various components. This included testing:
- Correctness of callback functions
- Rendering of visual elements
- Data handling logic

### Task 6: Automating the Test Suite for Dash Application

The final task involved automating the test suite for the Dash application. I integrated the tests into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline using tools like **pytest** and **GitHub Actions** to automatically run the tests whenever new code was pushed to the repository.

## Conclusion

This internship provided valuable experience in developing interactive data applications, ensuring their robustness through testing, and automating workflows. The skills learned during the program, such as **data processing**, **Dash development**, and **test automation**, are crucial for building scalable and reliable data-driven applications.
